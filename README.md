# Task 9: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

## Objective:
To identify time-based trends in customer purchase behavior and revenue generation.

## Tools Used:
SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL

## Key Queries Performed:
- Monthly revenue and order volume aggregation
- Identification of peak sales month
- Weekly customer buying pattern analysis
- Cumulative revenue trend (for PostgreSQL/MySQL)

## Key Insights:
- Sales peak in March, with ₹2.1L in revenue and 90+ orders.
- Sundays and Saturdays consistently see higher order volumes than weekdays.
- Weekdays like Thursday and Friday also perform well in terms of revenue.
- Customer activity shows a strong weekend bias, suggesting marketing campaigns could focus on Friday–Sunday.

## Next Steps:
- Break down trends by product category or region (if data available)
- Correlate trends with promotions or holidays

## Deliverables:
- SQL script with all aggregation queries
- Result tables (monthly, weekday sales)
- README summary with insights
